# Technical Charter (the “Charter”) for Technical Staging – OWF 

Adopted November 16, 2022

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Technical Staging – OWF open source project (the “Project”), which has been established as a project of the OpenWallet Foundation under Linux Foundation Europe, a Belgian private stichting headquartered at Kunstlaan 56, Brussels  (“LF Europe”).  All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter. 

<ol>
  <li>Mission and Scope of the Project</li>
    <ol>
      <li type="a">The mission of the Project is to support technical development relating to the Open Wallet Foundation. The Project intends to act as a staging area for contributions before the TAC and contribution contributors decide upon which OWF technical project a contribution should be housed.</li>
      <li type="a">The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>TAC Oversight</li>
    <ol>
      <li type="a">The technical advisory council of the Open Wallet Foundation (the “TAC”) will be responsible for technical oversight of the Project.  The TAC is expected to take a light approach to oversight while a contribution is housed within the Project and will work to facilitate transitioning of contributions to other technical projects of OWF.  Prior to establishment of the TAC, any committers of the Project acting together may perform the functions of the TAC under this Charter.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Compliance with Policies</li>
    <ol>
      <li type="a">Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Europe as may be adopted and amended by LF Europe, including, without limitation the policies listed at http://lfeurope.be/policies.
      <li type="a">The TAC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by LF Europe.  In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Europe Code of Conduct listed at http://lfeurope.be/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.
      <li type="a">When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Europe will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Europe, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project’s web site.
      <li type="a">All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TAC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community.
      <li type="a">The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to LF Europe.
